unary: 5 finger count to 31?

# base-1, base-2

01010101 - binary digit = bit (bit means binary digit, single bit is just 0 or 1)

Binary, it's the permutations, which ones are on and off, that matters.

# base-10

decimal 123...

# byte

And it happens to be a power of 2, 2 to the third 

11111111 = 255 = 1 bit

# representing letters 

we can asign letters to a number, as long as we agree. 65 is letter A. 01000001
ASCII table

# Unicode

sometimes it uses 16 bits or 24 bits or 32 bits per character and so on.

Because if the longest one is 32 bits, that's 2 to the 32, which, if you do out the math, trust me, is roughly 4 billion.
Unicode's mission really is to represent and to preserve all human languages digitally, both past, present, and future.
So it is really about capturing the entirety of human knowledge, as we've expressed it in language, but also giving this newfound ability that's been used centuries ago, too-- in writings, on walls, and the like-- pictograms via which we can still communicate, even independently of our own human language.
